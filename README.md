# My Final Project

This was an assignment from the course "Front-end Programming" from my University.

We had a ready Back-end, so we did a React Front-end:

1. **Table of Customers** where we can:
   + See all the Customers
   + Add new Customer
   + Edit info about a customer
   + Delete a customer
   + Export the data about customers in .csv format
   + Add a training to a customer (the training will appear in the Trainings table)
    
2. **Table of Trainings** where we did:
   + See all the Trainings
   + Delete the trainings

3. **Calendar** where we see Trainings and can change months and weeks to see relevant data.

4. **Statistics** where we see the chart with the quantity of the Trainings grouped by categories.
